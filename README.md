# Data-mining-based-model-for-detection-of-fradulent-behaviour-in-water-consumption
Developed a model using SVM and KNN to identify fraudulent water usage patterns, reducing non-technical losses for utility companies. Preprocessed data to remove redundant records, zero or null values, and new clients. Followed CRISP-DM methodology and created UML diagrams to document the systemâ€™s fraud detection processes.
